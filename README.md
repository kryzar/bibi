# Bibi Beamer

A pretty beamer class.

All contributions and feedback welcome!

## Install

You can put the file `bibi.cls` at the root of your beamer project, and use
`bibi` as the *document class*. See [example.tex](example.tex) for
self-contained example.

A more permanent way is to put the file in a subdirectory `tex/latex/` of your
`texmf` folder. On Linux, the `texmf` folder might be `~/.texmf`.

## Example

To compile the example, run `latexmk` in the directory.
